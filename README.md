# gest-IT corpus

The `gest-IT` corpus is an Italian multimodal corpus consisting of maximally ecological interactions, transcribed on three separate layers aligned to each other: 
* an orthographic transcription;
* a prosodic transcription;
* a gestural transcription.

The resource is concerned with sighted and visually impaired L1 speakers in dialogical situations. In total, the corpus contains recording of 6 blind and 8 sighted participants, recruited on a voluntary basis and through a protocol that has been evaluated as compliant with GDPR and ethical requirements (Positive evaluation of the Bioethics Committee of the University of Bologna n. 0020349, 24/01/2024.).

All participants were paired and later involved in 30-minutes seated conversations, to elicit samples of spontaneous speech. Pairs and interaction settings were built accordind to two parameters:
* speakers could belong to the same category of participant (both blind, both sighted) or different categories. We coded these two situations as **S** (_same_, blind-blind or sighted-sighted conversation) or **D** (_different_, blind-sighted conversation);
* speakers could be facing each other or be seated back-to-back, to ensure that participants could not perceive the other's nonverbal communication. We coded these two situations as **M** (_masked_, back-to-back situation) or **U** (_unmasked_, facing situation).

Overall, 13 conversations were recorded, for a total of roughly 7 hours.
